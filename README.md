Hi, I'm Duong
A third-year International Economics student at Foreign Trade University with strong analytical abilities and a growing passion for data and business analysis. Equipped with a solid academic foundation and hands-on coursework, I am eager to apply my skills in real-world business contexts through internship or entry-level opportunities.
